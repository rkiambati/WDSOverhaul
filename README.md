# WDSOverhaul

This is the Official GitHub Repo for the WDS Externals Overhaul Website
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This site is actively being changed and is not final, the description for the files and folders are as follows:

1. Index.html - The Main HTML file for the page, organized by section and div id's
2. Images - Image directory for all Images that will appear on the Overhaul Website. ANY photo that goes on the website must be placed here and not locally stored on the editor's device
3. Assets - The assets folder contains 3 important files:
   a. Content.json - This file is currently responsible for the information going on the testimonials, faq, and sponsor sections. If editing any of that information please ensure to make the changes on this file alone
   b. Main.js - This file, like index, is the main Javascript file for the website. it handles functionality pertaining to effects, animations, buttons, and dynamic scrolling effects such as the progress bar at the top. Any changes to those above must be done on Main.js
   c. Styles.css - This is also the main CSS file for the website, and contains all the styling and colouring for the website, text fonts, sizes, etc. This file follows the figma documentation provided as the main guideline for all colours, text fonts and sizes, with a little creativity. This file also calls some functions from Main.js for scroll effects
